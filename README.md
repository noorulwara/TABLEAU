# Overview
The Road Accident Analysis Dashboard helps visualize and analyze road accident data to identify key trends, such as accident hotspots, common causes, and accident severity. The goal is to provide valuable insights to improve road safety and support data-driven decision-making for policymakers, urban planners, and law enforcement.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes records of road accidents, capturing various attributes like:

Date and Time of the accident
Location (Latitude, Longitude, City)
Weather Conditions
Vehicle Involvement (Type of vehicles)
Accident Severity (Minor, Severe, Fatal)
Contributing Factors (Speeding, Drunk Driving, etc.)
You can download the dataset from [link to dataset].

# Key Features
This Tableau dashboard includes the following key features:

Interactive Maps: Visualize accident hotspots based on geographic location.
Time-Series Analysis: Track trends in accidents over time (by year, month, day, or hour).
Severity Breakdown: Analyze the severity of accidents and contributing factors.
Filter Options: Customize the view using filters (e.g., weather conditions, vehicle type, region).
Dynamic Visuals: Interactive charts and graphs that adjust based on user input.

# Installation and Setup
To get started with the dashboard, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/road-accident-dashboard.git

Ensure the dataset is available locally or online. Connect Tableau to the dataset and start exploring.

Dashboard Insights
The dashboard provides the following insights:

Accident Frequency by Location: Pinpoint accident-prone areas using heatmaps and geo-plots.
Contributing Factors: Identify leading causes of accidents, such as weather conditions or driving behavior.
Severity Analysis: Visualize accident severity distributions and trends.
Time of Day Impact: Determine how the time of day or week influences accident rates.
Feel free to explore and adjust filters to uncover more patterns and insights.
